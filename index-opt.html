                    <p>To the millions of us who visit Cape Cod once or twice a summer, the effects of climate change can seem subtle, if we see them at all: A breach in the dunes. A crack in the pavement. But once you know how to see what is shifting, changing and washing away, it is impossible to ignore.
                    </p>
                    <p>Come with us as we explore the Cape to better understand what climate change is doing here, what it means for the future of this beloved place, and what the cost of inaction might be.
